General TODOS:
- re-factor models to singletons + update calls
- verify all models use QueryResult<> typing for results
- consider translating all queries to strings (memory impact)
- clean up comments for DRY
- clean up imports + format docs

Phase 1
- players and games owned by users (including ai)
- users have id, username, password, email and admin flag
- default user exists and assigned if no authentication in place
- user data not returned in endpoints

Phase 2
- auth endpoints exist and token parsing exists on all endpoints
- all users are admins for all players and games

Phase 3
- client updated to leverage authentication

Phase 4
- remove default user logic
